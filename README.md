# AP CSA â€“ Lab 1.12: Objects and Classes

## ðŸ“˜ Instructions

1. **Fork this repository** into your own GitHub account.  
2. **Clone** your fork to your computer using GitHub Desktop or `git clone`.  
3. Open `src/Lab1_12.java` in VS Code.  
4. Complete the TODO parts in each method (`q1()` through `q4()`).  
   - Do not change method signatures.  
   - Use only topics up to Lesson 1.12 (Objects and Classes).  
5. Use the `main` method to test your work.  
6. Commit and push your changes to your fork.  
7. Submit a Pull Request (PR) back to the original repository.  

## âœ… Tasks

1. **Creating a Point**  
   - Create a `Point` object at coordinates `(5, 10)`.  
   - Use `.getX()` and `.getY()` to return the x- and y-values.  

2. **Moving a Point**  
   - Create a `Point` at `(0, 0)`.  
   - Use `.move(4, 7)` to change its location.  
   - Return the new coordinates.  

3. **Distance Between Points**  
   - Create two `Point` objects: `(0, 0)` and `(3, 4)`.  
   - Use `.distance(Point other)` to return the distance between them.  

4. **Two Different Objects**  
   - Create two different `Point` objects with the same values `(2, 2)`.  
   - Show that they are different objects even though the values match.  

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Learn to instantiate objects with `new`.  
- Call instance methods on objects.  
- Distinguish between class and object.
